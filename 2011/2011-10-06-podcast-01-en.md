[It’s been a while since we stopped our "Compile MP3 du Net"][i725]. Why?
Because the format wasn’t practical, because Dead Rooster’s server is too small
to host audio files on a daily basis, because everything.

So, we’re gonna experiment with something new: a podcast!

We’re not going to commit to a schedule yet for this podcast. Let’s just stay
we’ll try to put one online at least once every two months. The podcasting
philosophy is and will be : no talking, just 9 unedited songs. That’s the way we
like it.

With this post, we’d like to thank all the people we got in touch with to build
this first episode. If all the artists we contact in the future are as nice as
those, it will be pretty easy to keep a decent frequency. So thanks again to all
of you music involved people! (let’s just not use the word "industry" when
talking about music)

We hope you’ll enjoy the show.

(edit: the podcast has been discontinued)
