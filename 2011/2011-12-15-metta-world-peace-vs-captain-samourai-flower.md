Ron Artest s'appelle désormais Metta World Peace et [se réjouit que les hommes
perdent leurs dents quand ils sont bébés plutôt que quand ils ont 20 ou 30
ans][1]. Je crois qu'il vient de déclarer la guerre à [Captain Samouraï
Flower][i543].

Sa déclaration complète :

> Well, I'm just happy that Jesus Christ, um, did not let me lose my teeth when
> I was 20 years old. 'Cause I was wondering, like, what if you kept your baby
> teeth until the age of 18 or 20, and then you lose 'em? That would look pretty
> bad. So I just think he's really brilliant that you lose your teeth when
> you're a baby rather than you lose them when you're, like, 30 or 20. That has
> nothing to do with your question, but that was definitely on my mind.
>
> I was, um, just thinking about it. And I was just like, wow, what if I lost my
> teeth, like, today? And I'm 32. You know? And then my new teeth would grow
> back in. You know? I was just thinking about that. And I was like, that's
> really pretty brilliant; he actually thought about like people's image and,
> you know, persona and things like that. 'Cause you would be pretty ugly with
> no teeth at the age of 20, 18, you know? So not only did he build the world in
> seven days, seven nights, he also said, OK, let them lose their teeth early,
> rather than late.
